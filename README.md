# Usage
Download **hyperial**, edit `settings.bat` and then run `hyperial.bat` by double-clicking.

# Settings
```bat
:: Force using colors
set force_colors=false

:: Use UTF-8 encoding
set utf-8=true

:: Start WINDOWS TERMINAL with theme
set windows_terminal=true

:: Split WINDOWS TERMINAL into two panes with CMD and WSL
